# Gensyn-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Gensyn Protocol is a layer-1 trustless protocol for deep learning computation that rewards participants for their compute time. It facilitates task distribution and payments through smart contracts, ensures the verification of completed ML work and creates a decentralized AI compute network.

## Key Features
- Decentralized Compute Network: Gensyn connects machine learning (ML) hardware globally, forming a unified, decentralized "supercluster." This allows users to tap into a vast pool of GPUs and CPUs worldwide, bypassing the limitations of centralized cloud providers.
- Layer 1 Trustless Protocol: Built as a Layer 1 blockchain protocol, Gensyn ensures trustless deep learning computation. It uses cryptographic verification to guarantee transparency and reliability, enabling secure collaboration between untrusted parties.
- Cost Efficiency: By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, Gensyn reduces dependency on expensive centralized infrastructure, offering a pay-as-you-go model that aims to lower the cost of AI training and inference compared to traditional solutions.
- Scalability: The protocol is designed to scale dynamically, accommodating large-scale ML models that may not fit on a single device. It distributes workloads across the network, optimizing resource use and performance.
- Verification System: Gensyn employs advanced verification mechanisms (e.g., their "Verde" system) to ensure the accuracy of ML computations performed on untrusted nodes, addressing a core challenge in decentralized systems.
- Accessibility for Developers: The platform democratizes access to computational power, empowering developers, researchers, and organizations of all sizes to train AI models without needing massive upfront investments in hardware.
- Research-Driven Innovation: Gensyn’s team focuses on cutting-edge research, such as "SkipPipe" (communication-efficient decentralized training) and "Diverse Expert Ensembles" (parallel LLM training), enhancing the protocol’s efficiency and capabilities.

## Airdrop Details
Status: Confirmed via testnet rewards (per Litepaper), but no official date or specifics yet.

Eligibility: Join testnet—install a node (guide on gensyn.ai), fill out Supply and Access Compute forms, engage on X/Discord.

The complete testnet launch will be carried out in 4 phases.
1. RL Swarm — collaborative RL over the internet
2. Verde — trustless ML verification
3. SkipPipe — comms-efficient pipeline training
4. Diverse Expert Ensembles — new MoE architecture
